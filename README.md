## 📝 Description

This program implements the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest known encryption techniques used by Julius Caesar to protect his military communications.

You can:

- 🔐 **Encrypt** a message with a secret shift number

- 🔁 Run multiple times without restarting

It handles lowercase letters and preserves spaces, punctuation, and symbols.
